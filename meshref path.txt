Do you have the path anywhere in the UI, like a channel or anything

There is a FileReference object in lx.objects, that has a method Path() that returns a string, guessing you could try get the item as that and see if that gets you anywhere

It's a bit strange because it's sort of a half-finished API, but the "reference" tag for the mesh will be stored on the group locator it's inside of.  So if you can find that tag, you can use the SceneAssets api to get the reference path:
# Assuming you have the mesh selected...
import lxu

XREF_TAG = lxu.utils.lxID4('XREF')

def findXRefIdent(item):
	''' Find the unique 'XREF' tag associated with the
	given item, or None if it can't be found
	'''
	tag = item.GetTag(XREF_TAG)
	if tag is not None:
		return tag
		
	try:
		parent = item.Parent()
		return findXRefIdent(parent)
	except:
		return None


item = lxu.select.ItemSelection().current()[0]
tag = findXRefIdent(item)
if tag is not None:
	scene = item.Context()
	assets = scene.AllocAssets()
	path = assets.GetPath(None, tag)
	lx.out("Found asset path: \n%s\n" % path)
